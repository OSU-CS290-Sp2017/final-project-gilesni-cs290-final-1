# CS290-Final
Final Project for CS290 Spring 2017 @ Oregon State University

Basic Website using Express, handlebars, and node.js. Website allows for users and logins, then joining groups where they can partake in basic text chatting capabilities.

--->I have reconstructed the webpage via handlebars so that tomorrow we can work on the javascript
